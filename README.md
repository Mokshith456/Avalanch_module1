# Solidity Error Handling

This Solidity program demonstrates error handling in smart contracts. It includes functions that showcase different error handling mechanismsâ€”`require`, `assert`, and `revert`. These mechanisms are essential in Solidity to validate conditions and manage exceptions within smart contracts effectively.

## Description

The `Error_handling` contract in this Solidity program contains three functions:

1. `require_method`: Implements the `require` statement to validate conditions. It ensures that certain conditions are met; otherwise, it throws an error with a specific message.

2. `assert_method`: Utilizes the `assert` statement to check for conditions that must be true during contract execution. If any condition is not met, it leads to an exception.

3. `revert_method`: Uses the `revert` statement to explicitly revert state changes and stop execution if certain conditions are not fulfilled.

The purpose of this program is to provide a clear understanding of these error handling mechanisms in Solidity and how they can be employed to ensure the integrity of smart contracts by validating conditions and reverting transactions if necessary.

## Usage

### require_method
- **Parameters**: Two unsigned integers, x and y.
- **Description**: Ensures x is not zero, y is not zero, and x is divisible by y. Otherwise, it throws an error.

### assert_method
- **Parameters**: Two unsigned integers, p and q.
- **Description**: Ensures p and q are both greater than zero and that their product is greater than their sum. If not, an exception is triggered.

### revert_method
- **Parameters**: An unsigned integer, value.
- **Description**: If the value is not between 100 and 999, the transaction is reverted with a specific error message.

## Getting Started

To interact with this contract, deploy it using a development environment like Remix or on an Ethereum testnet. Once deployed, call the respective functions, providing the required parameters to test the error handling mechanisms.
